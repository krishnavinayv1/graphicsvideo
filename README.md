Graphics Assignment using opengl and blender

This is somewhat like a project in which we have to make a video with characters to convey any theme..

My project:-

1) It is 4-5  minutes video created  using OPENGL and BLENDER.
2) We selected a script that shows the inner feelings of some children who resides at terrorist or naxal prone areas..
3) We made some guns, boys and guard characaters and some trees and houses.
4) We recorded the video by projecting the camera to different places and with background narration also...

You can see the complete code and details there at the given link as it takes large memory..
